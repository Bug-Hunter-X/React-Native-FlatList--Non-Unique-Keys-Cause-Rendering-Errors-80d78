The solution is to provide unique keys to each item in the `FlatList` data. This can be done by using a unique identifier from your data source, or, as a less efficient alternative, by using the item index. 

Here's how to fix the `BuggyFlatList.js` example:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { FlatList, Text, View } from 'react-native';

const data = [
  { id: 1, name: 'Item 1' },
  { id: 2, name: 'Item 2' },
  { id: 3, name: 'Item 3' },
];

const FixedFlatList = () => (
  <FlatList
    data={data}
    keyExtractor={(item) => item.id.toString()}
    renderItem={({ item }) => (
      <View style={{ padding: 10, borderBottomWidth: 1, borderBottomColor: '#ccc' }}>
        <Text>{item.name}</Text>
      </View>
    )}
  />
);

export default FixedFlatList;
```

Notice that the `keyExtractor` prop is used to generate a unique key for each item using the item's `id`.
If you don't have a unique identifier in your data you can generate one or, less efficiently, use the index as a fallback but remember that this approach can cause problems when items are inserted or removed from the list.
