This error occurs when using the `FlatList` component in React Native and you are not providing a unique `key` prop for each item in your data array.  React Native uses the `key` prop to identify and track each item in the list. If the keys are not unique, React Native may not be able to efficiently update the list, leading to unexpected behavior such as incorrect rendering or performance issues.  This is especially problematic when inserting or deleting items from the list.
